                        <p>We act in solidarity with health workers, activists and communities worldwide to improve health and challenge the causes of poverty.
                        We tackle unfair power structures to challenge the real root causes of poverty & ill health.
                        We work alongside affected communities and activist groups to expose global inequalities, and we offer solutions to the contemporary systems that
                        put profits over people's health. FeedMeFoundation is a nonprofit orginization. Our community is free to join, and we do not charge an application or subscription fee. Instead, we retain a 5–12% nonprofit support fee on donations, plus 3% transaction processing fee. But we’re committed to raising even more money for your organization than we retain in fees. For example, for every $1 that goes to FeedMeFoundation in fees, we’ll raise, on average, an additional $2 for your nonprofit. In 2021, FeedMeFoundation drove nearly $20 million in extra funding to nonprofits, making access to the community essentially free for most of our partners.</p>

                <p>Growing up, many of us had the privelege of exchanging gifts on birthdays and festive holidays such as Christmas and Easter. It is a general tradition to "give" amongst family and friends
                across many cultures, especially mine. Through my personal development I have learned that one of the noblest values I can adopt into my code of ethics is altruism, selfless concern for the 
                well-being of others, and since we give our friends and family out of love and compassion - this can be considered an extension of that tradition. If we have love in our hearts when gifting each other, then how can we not gift those in need with at least the bare essentials for a basic life that all humans deserve? In the beautiful words of the late Nelson Mandela,
                “A fundamental concern for others in our individual and community lives would go a long way in making the world the better place we so passionately dreamt of.”<br>My name is Joe Haddad, and I would love to have you on board!
